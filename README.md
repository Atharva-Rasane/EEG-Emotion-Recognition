# EEG-Based Emotion Recognition Using Genetic Algorithm Optimized Multi-Layer Perceptron
***Abstract:*** Emotion Recognition is an important problemwithin Affective Computing and Human Computer Interaction.In recent years, various machine learning models have providedsignificant progress in the field of emotion recognition. Thispaper proposes a framework for EEG-based emotion recog-nition using Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP). Power SpectralDensity features were used for quantifying the emotions interms of valence-arousal scale and MLP is used for classification.Genetic algorithm is used to optimize the architecture of MLP.The proposed model identifies a. two classes of emotions viz. Low/High Valence with an average accuracy of 91.10% andLow/High Arousal with an average accuracy of 91.02%, b. fourclasses of emotions viz. High Valence-Low Arousal (HVLA), High Valence-High Arousal (HVHA), Low Valence-Low Arousal (LVLA) and Low Valence-High Arousal (LVHA) with 83.52%accuracy.The reported results are better compared to existing results in the literature.<br/>
